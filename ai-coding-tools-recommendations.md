# AI Coding Tools - Next Recommendations

Based on your repository and extensive hands-on experimentation, here are AI coding tools you should try next, organized by what they'd add to your research.

## Agentic/Autonomous Coding Tools (Next Frontier)

### Cursor
You've tried many tools but not Cursor, which pioneered the "agentic IDE" category before Windsurf. Notable for:
- Composer mode (multi-file editing with planning)
- @-mentions for context control
- Different model than your current stack
- Strong enterprise adoption signals
- Worth comparing to Windsurf/Claude Code for your selection criteria

### Aider
CLI-based agentic coding assistant that would complement your research:
- Works with any editor
- Git-aware, creates atomic commits
- Benchmark-driven (shows actual measurements)
- Open source, supports multiple LLMs
- Aligns with your SDD/measurement focus

### Cody (Sourcegraph)
Enterprise-focused AI coding assistant:
- Deep codebase understanding (they built code search)
- Context fetching at scale
- Multi-repo awareness
- Enterprise security/governance focus
- Fits your "developer-of-future" enterprise research

## Specialized Workflow Tools

### Continue.dev
Open-source autopilot for VS Code/JetBrains:
- Highly customizable (good for experimentation)
- Slash commands for workflows
- Works with local models
- Community-driven patterns
- Would complement your workflow impact research

### Tabnine
For comparing privacy-first/on-prem approaches:
- On-premises deployment option
- No code training policy (day 1)
- Team learning models
- Enterprise governance angle
- Useful for your security/privacy selection criteria

## Code Quality & Testing Specialists

### Codium AI (PR-Agent + AlphaCodium)
For your quality/measurement focus:
- PR-Agent: automated PR reviews with metrics
- Test generation focused on correctness
- Integration with CI/CD
- Measurable impact on code quality
- Aligns with your workflow impact research (ai-workflow-impact.md)

### Qodo (formerly CodiumAI Cover-Agent)
Test generation specialist:
- Focused solely on increasing test coverage
- Measurable outcomes
- CI/CD integration
- Fits your "measuring impact" problem domain

## Research & Analysis Tools

### Codeium
Free alternative worth comparing:
- Different model approach
- Autocomplete + chat + command
- Free tier (good for adoption research)
- Compare adoption patterns vs paid tools

### Amazon Q Developer (formerly CodeWhisperer)
AWS ecosystem:
- Security scanning built-in
- Reference tracking (IP concerns)
- Enterprise AWS integration
- Different vendor for comparison

## Experimental/Emerging

### Replit Agent
End-to-end app builder:
- Goes beyond coding to deployment
- Worth comparing to GitHub Spark
- Different interaction model
- Could inform your SDD research

### Zed AI
Performance-focused editor with AI:
- Collaboration-first
- Speed claims (latency focus)
- Newer approach to agentic features
- Might represent next evolution

### v0.dev / bolt.new
Rapid prototyping:
- Prompt-to-app generators
- Different from coding assistants
- Worth testing for PRD→app flow
- Could validate your SDD approach

## Recommendations Based on Your Focus

### For your enterprise research (measuring-impact.md, ai-tool-selection):
1. **Cursor** - Missing major player in your comparison
2. **Cody** - Enterprise angle you haven't covered
3. **Codium PR-Agent** - Measurable workflow integration

### For your SDD work (spec-driven-dev):
1. **Aider** - Git-aware, atomic commits, spec-friendly
2. **Continue.dev** - Customizable workflows you can shape
3. **Replit Agent** - Tests SDD hypothesis at extreme

### For your skill development research (ai-mentoring, ai-fluency):
1. **Tabnine** - Different learning curve
2. **Codeium** - Free adoption patterns
3. **Amazon Q** - Security-first skills

## Top Priority Recommendations

### 1. Cursor
**Glaring omission from your tool experiments**, different enough from Windsurf to justify comparison. Pioneered the agentic IDE space and has strong enterprise adoption.

### 2. Aider
**CLI-based, measurement-focused**, would produce unique insights for your research. Open source with benchmark data aligns with your scientific approach to measuring impact.

### 3. Codium PR-Agent
**Directly addresses workflow impact measurement**, fits your research goals perfectly. Provides concrete metrics on code quality improvements in CI/CD workflows.

## Rationale

These recommendations fill gaps in your current coverage and align with your "head chef" philosophy (from Vibe Coding) and focus on what's likely to persist: workflows, measurements, and quality outcomes rather than just coding speed.

Your experiments have covered the major consumer-focused tools (Claude Code, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Gemini tools, Spark), but are missing:
- Enterprise-focused alternatives (Cody, Cursor at scale)
- CLI/git-native tools (Aider)
- Quality/testing specialists (Codium, Qodo)
- Privacy-first options (Tabnine)

These gaps matter for your enterprise research on tool selection, workflow impact, and developer skill evolution.
