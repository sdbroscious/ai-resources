# Experiments

Catalog of AI coding tools and applications experimented with.

## Files

- **[tools.md](tools.md)** — Catalog of AI coding tools experimented with (Claude Code, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, Gemini tools, etc.) and GenAI apps used for various projects.

- **[apps.md](apps.md)** — Detailed list of applications built with various AI coding tools, including whiskey-log, taskflow, todoist clones, Connect Four, and work-related apps.

## Purpose

These files track hands-on experimentation with different AI coding assistants and tools to understand their capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses. This practical experience informs the recommendations and frameworks in other parts of the repository.
