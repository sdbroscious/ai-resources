    - using AI and 
    - using it well
- maybe the metrics below should be combined into a scorecard
    - possible x-ref with git commits or PRs?

## options

### using
- total interactions
- days active
- average interactions (total interactions / days active)
- premium requests total
- premium requests per days active?

### using it well

- agent vs ask
- CLI usage?
