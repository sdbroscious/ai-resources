Resources and planning documents specific to organizational AI adoption initiatives.

## Directories

### GAIG (Generative AI Group) - `gaig/`

Resources and planning documents specific to the GAI (Generative AI) Lab initiatives and SDD implementation work at GAIG.

- **[gai-ai-lab-plans.md](gaig/gai-ai-lab-plans.md)** — Strategic framework for AI adoption organized into two prongs: "Developer of the Future" (Lab focus on dev skills, design, critical thinking) and "Development of the Future" (IT focus on AI fluency, SDD workflow, and process inputs).

- **[gai-ai-players.md](gaig/gai-ai-players.md)** — List of people and teams for POCs and initiatives across GAS Lab, SDLC COE, API COE, EISG, Data Science, and Emerging Tech.

- **[gai-sdd-overview.md](gaig/gai-sdd-overview.md)** — GAI-focused overview of Spec-Driven Development covering crisis of abundance, determinism, paved path approach, key components (process, constitution, operationalization), and various framework options to consider.

- **[gai-sdd-notes.md](gaig/gai-sdd-notes.md)** — Meeting notes from GAI Lab discussions on SDD workflow/kit, including Rally integration, constitution elements (skills, instructions, agents, prompts), and scope considerations.

- **[gai-ai-feed-beast.md](gaig/gai-ai-feed-beast.md)** — Analysis of the "yawning void" problem: AI-enabled developers delivering faster than stories arrive, with options for spinning plates, TPM leverage, faster feature cycling, A/B testing, and collaborative story/spec cycles.

- **[gai-ai-user-metrics.md](gaig/gai-ai-user-metrics.md)** — Framework for measuring individual developer AI tool usage and effectiveness through metrics like total interactions, days active, model usage breakdown, agent vs. ask patterns, and CLI usage.

## Purpose

This directory contains organization-specific planning documents, team rosters, and implementation strategies. These documents adapt the general frameworks from `dev-of-future/` to specific organizational contexts and needs.
