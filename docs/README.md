# Documentation

Foundational documents and high-level resources for understanding AI-augmented software development.

## Files

- **[ai-principles.md](ai-principles.md)** — Guiding metaphors (Yegge/Kim's "head chef" concept from *Vibe Coding*) and eras of AI coding assistance (code completion → chat → agentic).

- **[ai-lessons.md](ai-lessons.md)** — Key lessons learned: rapid tooling/thought pattern change, persistence of SDD, variable developer adoption, and enduring concerns around value/quality/speed.

- **[sdd-pitch.md](sdd-pitch.md)** — Overview pitch for Spec-Driven Development (SDD) in the context of "vibe coding," including advantages, disadvantages, and the "vibe then verify" approach.

- **[coding-tools-recommendations.md](coding-tools-recommendations.md)** — Claude Code-generated recommendations for AI coding tools to explore next, organized by category (agentic tools, specialized workflow tools, quality/testing specialists, experimental tools) with prioritized suggestions.
