# first principles

## guiding metaphor (Yegge/Kim)

“In this new world, you’re the head chef of a world-class kitchen. As such, you don’t personally dice every vegetable, sear every steak, swish away every cockroach, or plate every dish. You have sous chefs and line chefs for that. But when a meal leaves the kitchen, it’s your reputation on the line and your Michelin stars at stake. When the customer sends back the fish because it’s overdone or the sauce is broken, you can’t blame your sous chef.
 
The same principle applies when coding with AI: Delegation of implementation doesn’t mean delegation of responsibility.”

## eras of AI coding assistance
- 2022–2023: “code completion” goes mainstream
- 2023 (late)–2024: “chat” becomes the primary interaction model
- 2025–2026: “agentic” workflows emerge (plan–act–verify)
