# AI SDD Pitch

## Overview
* **"vibe coding"**
    * love or hate it, the term does embody the rapid speed and large volume of AI code generation
* **"vibe then verify"**
    * de-risk the large volume of code coming at high velocity
* **spec-driven development**
    * buttresses the verification aspect of vibe coding
        * wind at the back of accomplished developers
        * guardrails to support less accomplished developers (junior and citizen)
    * iterations of plan > verify > implement > verify

## SDD Advantages
* enables validation of AI
    * plans
    * implementations
* consistent, persistent context for
    * AI tool
    * human devs
* increases determinism by setting repeatable boundaries/rules
* breaks work down into more manageable modules
* 'process' is better for larger scale work
* cleaner code (**GAI**)
* tighter alignment with architecture and policies (**GAI**)
* better documentation and traceability (**GAI**)

## SDD Disadvantages
* waterfall trap (**GAI**)
* documentation maintenance burden (**GAI**)
* non-determinism still persists
* 'process' can get in the way of smaller scale work
