 # lessons so far
 
* tooling change is rapid and fluid
* thought pattern change is rapid and fluid
* you can't do nothing
	* seek what's likely to last and go there
		* e.g., SDD addresses new constraints and so is likely to persist
	* developer adoption success is variable
	* traditional concerns (value, quality, speed) are still valid
