# Problem Context

## Department Overview
* My department has roughly 35 developers.
* We also have 3 developer practice leads.
* The 35 developers range in experience from very early career to very experienced.

## Current Skill Levels
* Software design skills are limited among the developers (but not the leads).
* Software architectural skills are even more limited among the developers (but not the leads).

## Issues and Challenges
* These limitations are causing development teams to miss opportunities and box themselves in when coding product solutions.
* Example 1: A recent project failed to implement a scalable architecture, leading to performance issues.
* Example 2: Lack of design patterns knowledge resulted in code that is difficult to maintain and extend.

## Goals
* Improve software design skills among developers.
* Enhance software architectural skills among developers.

## Current Efforts
* Developers on product teams are pair by default.
* Enterprise, solution and application architecture resources are ad hoc.

## Desired Outcomes
* Developers can independently design scalable and maintainable software solutions.
* Reduced number of issues related to poor design and architecture in projects.
* Increased overall productivity and quality of the development process.
