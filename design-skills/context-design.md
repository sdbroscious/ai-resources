# Problem Context

* My department has roughly 35 developers.
* We also have 3 developer practice leads.
* These developers range in experience from very early career to very experienced.
* Software design skills are limited among the developers (but not the leads).
* Software architectural skills are even more limited among the developers (but not the leads).
* These limitations are causing development teams to miss opportunities and box themselves in when coding product solutions.
