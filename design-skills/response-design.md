Having spent many years mentoring developers and seeing similar challenges, I understand the situation you're facing. Let me help devise a structured approach to elevate your team's design and architectural capabilities.

Based on the context, I notice two key advantages we can leverage:
1. You have a good developer-to-lead ratio (roughly 12:1)
2. You have experienced leads who can serve as knowledge anchors

Here's what I propose as a multi-faceted approach:

**1. Design Review Culture**
We should establish regular design review sessions where developers present their solution approaches before significant implementation. This creates opportunities to:
- Share knowledge in a practical context
- Identify design improvements early
- Let junior developers learn from more experienced colleagues
- Allow leads to guide without dictating

**2. Architecture Office Hours**
I've found great success implementing weekly "office hours" where leads make themselves available for:
- Design discussions
- Architecture consultations
- Pattern recommendations
- General guidance

**3. Learning Through Pairing**
Consider implementing a rotating pair-design system where:
- Developers pair with different experience levels
- Focus is specifically on design decisions
- Sessions are time-boxed (perhaps 2 hours)
- Pairs document and share their key decisions

**4. Case Study Workshops**
Monthly workshops where:
- Teams present real challenges they've faced
- Discussion of alternative approaches
- Leads guide conversation about trade-offs
- Focus on practical examples from your actual codebase

**5. Design Pattern Library**
Build a living document of:
- Successful patterns used in your codebase
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Context for when to use specific approaches
- Real examples from your projects

What aspects of this approach resonate most with your team's culture and constraints? We can adjust the strategy based on your specific needs.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or discuss implementation details for a specific aspect?
