# ai-resources

This repo is intended to consolidate work that i do with Generative AI tools. It could be high-order work, like figuring out how to assess the impact of AI coding assistants on developer workflows. It could be app-specific prompts and PRDs re vibe coding.

- **dev-of-the-future**
    - **design-skills**: This directory contains work done late in 2024, right after my back surgery. It's goal is to help me understand how I can work to help developers embrace the AI-era of coding.
    - **workflow-impact**: This directory contains prompts and responses around the question of how to capture and analyze data around AI's impact on developer workflows and the SDLC
    - **first-principles**: This is a document in which I capture my thinking on AI at farely high level
    - **ai-tool-selection**: This is a document that outlines selection criteria for AI coding assistants.


- **whiskey-log**: This is an app I've vibe-coded using Claude Code, mainly. I've used other tools, like GH Copilot and Gemini Code Assist, but nowhere near the extent of Claude Code. Here's the [github repo](https://github.com/sdbroscious/whiskey-log).
