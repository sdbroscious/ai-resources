# ai-resources

This repo is intended to consolidate work that i do with Generative AI tools. It could be high-order work, like figuring out how to assess the impact of AI coding assistants on developer workflows. It could be app-specific prompts and PRDs re vibe coding.

## Developer of the Future
- **dev-of-the-future**
    - **ai-tool-selection**: This directory contains artifacts related to defining selection criteria for AI coding assistants.
    - **design-skills**: This directory contains work done late in 2024, right after my back surgery. It's goal is to help me understand how I can work to help developers embrace the AI-era of coding.
    - **workflow-impact**: This directory contains prompts and responses around the question of how to capture and analyze data around AI's impact on developer workflows and the SDLC
    - **spec-driven-dev**: This directory contains reports and other material related to spec-driven development, an emerging approach to AI-assisted coding.
    - **ai_code_mentoring**: This document is a comprehensive and deeply researched report on the concept of "AI Fluency" for software developers, synthesizing academic studies, industry surveys, and corporate case studies from 2023-2025. It argues that true fluency is far more than just using AI tools; it's a strategic capability that requires structured training, new workflows, and a shift in developer skills.
    - **ai_fluency**: This document outlines a comprehensive, research-backed framework for experienced software engineers to coach their development teams on effectively using AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot. The core thesis is that peer coaching from a credible, internal practitioner is significantly more effective than generic, external training.
    - **first-principles**: This is a document in which I capture my thinking on AI at farely high level

## Apps Created with AI Assistants
- **whiskey-log**: This is an app I've 'vibe-coded' using Claude Code, mainly. I've also used other tools, like GH Copilot and Gemini Code Assist, but relatively sparingly. This also has a PRD that I created iteratively, adding requirements as building, testing and using the app revealed them. In theory, I should be able to take the PRD, create a new repo, and have an AI assistant recreate the app to its current state. Here's the [github repo](https://github.com/sdbroscious/whiskey-log).

- **taskflow**: This ia an app that I created with Windsurf in 2025-05. It's modeled on Todoist. Apparently, I was able to create a working app in a single day, with 2 basic commits: one for the code and a second for tests. Here's the [github repo](https://github.com/sdbroscious/taskflow).

- **todoist-clone**: This is an app that I created with Claude Code in 2025/05-06. It was an experiment in recreating Todoist as a VueJS and Spring Boot app. Here's the [github repo](https://github.com/sdbroscious/todoist-clone).

- **connectfour**: This is an app that I created with GitHub Copilot (Agent mode) in less than 30 minutes. It's the game you know and love. Here's the [github repo](https://github.com/sdbroscious/connectfour).

- **todoist-vsc-demo**: This is an app that I created with GitHub Copilot (Agent mode). It created a functional app on an extremely parsimonious prompt. For some reason, the README file in the backend directory is the one to review. Here's the [github repo](https://github.com/sdbroscious/todoist-vsc-demo).

- **app-from-image-claude**: This is an app that I ask Claude (not Code) to build based solely on a screen shot I took of the Todoist web interface. It produced a functioning CRUD app...crazy. Here's the [githup repo](https://github.com/sdbroscious/app-from-image-claude).

- **whiskey-log-ghc-cli**: This is based on whiskey-log. The experiment here is to take the prd.md file created by Claude Code for v1 of the app and see whether Copilot CLI can recreate the app. So far I have the PRD converted to an action plan and Copilot CLI and I are working the steps. Here's the [githup repo](https://github.com/sdbroscious/whiskey-log-ghc-cli).

- **antigravity-todoist**: This is an app that I created with Gemini Antigravity in 2025-11. It's modeled on Todoist. Here's the [github repo](https://github.com/sdbroscious/antigravity-todoist).
