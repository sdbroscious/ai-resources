# ai-resources

A curated repository of resources for AI-augmented software development: principles, organizational planning, workflow experiments, and Spec-Driven Development (SDD) artifacts.

## Overview

The repository is organized into six primary content areas:

- [axioms/](axioms/) - Foundational concepts and framing docs.
- [dev-of-future/](dev-of-future/) - Problem domains and detailed research artifacts.
- [ai-constructs/](ai-constructs/) - AI assistant instructions and reusable skills.
- [organization/](organization/) - Organization-specific planning materials.
- [experiments/](experiments/) - Tool and app experimentation logs.
- [x-archive/](x-archive/) - Archived historical prompts and outputs.

Supporting note:
- [docs/REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md](docs/REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md) - Historical summary of a prior repository reorganization.
