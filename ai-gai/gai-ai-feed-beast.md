# Conundrum: AI coding is allowing developers to deliver faster

## situation: yawning void
- waiting on stories to work
- waiting on non-dev testing to complete

## options
- spinning plates
- TPM leverage AI tooling
- TPM/PO faster feature cyclinh
- greater variation
    - A/B testing
    - prototype any/all ideas
- collaboration re story > specification cycle

## filling the void
- need to mind that what we do allows TPMs to continue to create newrefined stories
