# Developer Diary Template

This template is designed for developers to quickly log how AI coding assistants affect their daily or weekly work. Entries can later be aggregated and analyzed to detect workflow pattern changes across teams.

## 3. Workflow Impact
- **Did AI change when or how you did your work today?**
- **Did AI reduce or increase context switching?**
- **Did you delegate entire tasks to AI, or use it interactively as you worked?**
- **How much effort did you spend crafting prompts or providing context to AI?**
  - ☐ Minimal
  - ☐ Moderate
  - ☐ Significant

---

## 4. Trust & Verification
- **How thoroughly did you review AI-generated output before using it?**
  - ☐ Line-by-line review
  - ☐ Spot-checked key areas
  - ☐ Ran tests and accepted if they passed
  - ☐ Used with minimal review
- **How confident were you in shipping AI-generated code today?**
  - ☐ Very confident
  - ☐ Somewhat confident
  - ☐ Not confident
- **Did AI produce anything you almost missed that would have caused a problem?**

---

## 5. Benefits
- **Where did AI save you time or effort today?**
- **Did it help you focus or stay "in flow"?**

---

## 6. Challenges
- **Where did AI slow you down, confuse you, or create extra rework?**
- **Any quality issues introduced by AI suggestions?**

---

## 7. Collaboration & Review
- **Did AI change how you interacted with your team (e.g., in code reviews, handoffs, discussions)?**
- **Did you test or review AI-generated code differently than your own?**

---

## 8. Overall Sentiment
- **How did using AI affect your day?**
  - ☐ Positive
  - ☐ Negative
  - ☐ Mixed
- **Would you want to use AI more, less, or about the same tomorrow? Why?**

---

**How to use:**
- Fill in daily or weekly (5–10 minutes).
- Responses can be collected in Markdown files, spreadsheets, or a form.
- Entries can be coded using common categories (AI use type, workflow shift, outcome, sentiment, collaboration, trust) for pattern analysis.
