The provided context outlines challenges and goals related to improving software design and architectural skills among a department of developers. Below is a summary and suggestions for a path forward:

Summary of the Context

Department Structure
	•	35 developers with varying levels of experience.
	•	3 developer practice leads with strong design and architectural skills.

Key Issues
	1.	Limited software design and architectural skills among developers.
	2.	Missed opportunities and inefficient solutions due to inadequate design practices.
	•	Example: Lack of scalable architecture leading to performance issues.
	•	Example: Absence of design patterns causing maintenance difficulties.

Current Practices
	•	Default pair programming for developers.
	•	Ad hoc use of architectural resources.

Goals
	•	Improve individual developers’ design and architectural capabilities.
	•	Enhance scalability, maintainability, and overall code quality.
	•	Increase productivity and reduce design-related project issues.

Suggested Path Forward

Phase 1: Assessment and Training
	1.	Skill Assessment:
	•	Conduct a skills inventory to identify specific gaps in software design and architecture knowledge.
	•	Use surveys, coding challenges, or interviews to gather insights.
	2.	Training Programs:
	•	Organize workshops or bootcamps focused on foundational and advanced design principles.
	•	Topics to include: design patterns, scalable architecture, and maintainability.
	•	Leverage the expertise of the developer practice leads to create tailored learning paths.
	3.	Certifications and Resources:
	•	Encourage developers to pursue relevant certifications (e.g., TOGAF for architecture, or design patterns workshops).
	•	Provide access to books, courses, and online platforms like Pluralsight or Udemy.

Phase 2: Practice and Application
	1.	Mentorship Program:
	•	Pair less experienced developers with practice leads or senior developers for design mentorship.
	•	Set structured goals for learning through real-world projects.
	2.	Design Reviews:
	•	Introduce mandatory design reviews as part of the development lifecycle.
	•	Include both peer reviews and oversight by practice leads.
	3.	Rotational Architecture Role:
	•	Create a rotating role where developers work closely with the architecture team for a specific duration to learn directly from experts.

Phase 3: Embedding and Scaling
	1.	Standardized Practices:
	•	Develop and disseminate best practices, templates, and guidelines for design and architecture.
	•	Implement design and architectural checklists for projects.
	2.	Knowledge Sharing:
	•	Organize regular “design talks” or brown-bag sessions where teams share learnings and successes.
	•	Maintain a repository of case studies on successful project designs.
	3.	Measure Progress:
	•	Use metrics such as reduction in design-related issues, increased scalability of projects, or improvements in developer confidence.
