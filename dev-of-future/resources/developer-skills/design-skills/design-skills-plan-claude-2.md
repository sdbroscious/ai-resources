Thank you for the enriched context. With this additional information - especially knowing about your pair programming culture and the specific challenges around scalability and maintainability - I can offer a more targeted approach.

Given that developers already pair by default, let's build upon that foundation while addressing the architectural gaps:

**Phase 1: Foundation Building (Months 1-3)**
1. Structured Architecture Reviews
   - Weekly sessions where leads rotate through teams
   - Focus on current work, not theoretical examples
   - Teams present their design decisions and get immediate feedback
   - Document decisions and rationales in a shared knowledge base

2. Pattern Practice Program
   - Identify common patterns from your successful projects
   - Create hands-on exercises around your actual performance and maintainability challenges
   - Use your Example 1 (scalability issue) as a case study
   - Pair senior/junior developers to work through these exercises

**Phase 2: Skill Development (Months 3-6)**
1. Enhanced Pairing Strategy
   - Add explicit design/architecture objectives to pairing sessions
   - Create a "design buddy" system where each developer has a go-to person for design discussions
   - Rotate pairs to expose developers to different perspectives and expertise levels

2. Architecture Clinics
   - Bi-weekly sessions where teams can bring design challenges
   - Leads facilitate discussion but developers propose solutions
   - Focus on scalability and maintainability concerns
   - Document patterns and anti-patterns discovered

**Phase 3: Practice and Application (Months 6-12)**
1. Design Review Process
   - Implement lightweight design reviews at project inception
   - Create templates that guide thinking about scalability and maintainability
   - Require documentation of key design decisions
   - Regular review of outcomes against initial designs

2. Architecture Guild
   - Monthly meetings focused on broader architectural concerns
   - Developers present solutions they've implemented
   - Discuss what worked, what didn't, and why
   - Share learnings across teams

**Measurement & Feedback**
- Track the number of production issues related to design/architecture
- Monitor the complexity and maintainability metrics of new code
- Regular surveys of developer confidence in design decisions
- Document and review cases where teams successfully avoided previous pitfalls

Given your current pair programming culture, what aspects of this approach do you think would integrate most smoothly? Also, would you like me to elaborate on any particular phase or component?
