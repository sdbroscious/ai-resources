# Six Dimensions of AI Tool Selection

> From "Developer of the Future" notebook (NotebookLM) - 2025-12-28

According to the sources, organizations evaluate AI tools through a structured Evaluation Criteria Matrix that scores potential solutions across six specific dimensions to align technical analysis with strategic business outcomes.
These six dimensions include:

- Technical Capabilities: This dimension evaluates the core performance of the tool, its accuracy, and its ability to handle multi-step tasks. It also involves assessing the quality of data sources, the frequency of update schedules, and the tool's ability to produce reliable, reproducible results.

- Security & Compliance: Evaluators analyze the tool's alignment with industry standards such as SOC2 and ISO 27001, as well as its protocols for data encryption and intellectual property (IP) protection. This includes verifying that the tool adheres to data privacy regulations like GDPR, CCPA, or HIPAA to prevent catastrophic leaks of proprietary code or sensitive information.

- Usability & Adoption: This focus area considers the user experience, including how intuitive the interface is and if there is a minimal learning curve for developers. Key factors include IDE integration, accessibility standards (such as support for screen readers), and the availability of training resources and technical support.

- Cost & Value: Organizations weigh the subscription fees and total cost of ownership against the potential Return on Investment (ROI) derived from time savings and increased developer capacity.

- Vendor Reliability: This involves assessing the vendor's long-term stability, the responsiveness of their technical support teams, and the transparency of their product updates.

- IT Infrastructure / IT-Specific Requirements: The final dimension rates the tool's scalability, its compatibility with the existing tech stack (including various operating systems and browsers), and the availability of API options for deeper integration into the development pipeline.
Implementation and Decision Logic
The evaluation process is typically conducted by a multi-disciplinary team—including members from IT, security, procurement, and executive leadership—who assign ratings based on weighted, objective rubrics. The final weighted score often triggers a specific deployment path: high-scoring tools may move to direct deployment, mid-range tools move into a controlled pilot phase, and low-scoring tools require executive justification to proceed.

Analogy Evaluating an AI tool using these six dimensions is like inspecting a new engine for a commercial ship. You don’t just look at its raw speed (Technical Capability); you must also ensure it fits the current engine room (IT Infrastructure), is supported by a reliable manufacturer for parts (Vendor Reliability), won't consume more fuel than it saves in labor (Cost & Value), is easy for the crew to operate without constant errors (Usability), and, most importantly, meets all maritime safety standards to prevent a fire at sea (Security & Compliance).
