# AI-enabled SDLC maturity model 

> From "Developer of the Future" notebook (NotebookLM) - 2025-12-28

### Overview

The AI-enabled SDLC maturity model consists of five progressive stages that track an organization's journey from manual development to a fully AI-orchestrated environment 1, 2.

- **Level 0 – Classic SDLC**: This initial level is defined by traditional manual practices such as agile, kanban, or waterfall 1. While these processes are stable and familiar, they lack AI integration and rely entirely on human execution 1, 2.
    
- **Level 1 – AI-Assisted**: At this stage, fragmented experimentation begins as individual practitioners adopt tools like code assistants, design generators, or basic test automation 1. Progress is real but often inconsistent because the tools are used in isolation rather than as a cohesive organizational strategy 1, 3.
    
- **Level 2 – AI-Optimized**: Organizations reach this level when they formalize AI adoption by establishing governance, selecting standardized tools, and integrating them into the development pipeline 1. This alignment produces measurable efficiency gains across the lifecycle, though collaboration still largely follows traditional human-led patterns 1, 4.
    
- **Level 3 – Agent-Augmented**: This stage marks a significant shift as planning agents begin coordinating end-to-end workflows and managing handoffs across different roles 1, 2. Humans move "over the loop," shifting their focus from performing individual tasks to providing high-level direction and validation 1, 5.
    
- **Level 4 – Agent-Native**: The final level represents a fully AI-orchestrated environment where the entire process is optimized for machine intelligence 1. Human expertise is reserved for strategy, design, and value creation, while AI agents handle the bulk of implementation and operational tasks 1, 2.
    

### Summary Analogy

Moving through these levels is like the transition from transportation by horse to a modern autonomous car 4. 

- Level 0 is the horse and carriage—reliable but limited by human and animal stamina 1, 4. 
- Levels 1 and 2 are like adding a motor and better steering, making the journey faster but still requiring a driver's hands on the wheel at all times 1. 
- By Levels 3 and 4, you have transitioned to an autonomous vehicle where the human is no longer driving but is instead the navigator, deciding the destination while the internal systems manage the complex mechanics of the trip 1, 6.
