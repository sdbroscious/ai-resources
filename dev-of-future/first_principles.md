x# First Principles

- prompt vs spec engineering
    - [article](https://strategizeyourcareer.com/p/prompt-engineering-vs-spec-engineering)
        - **prompt engineering**: when task is small, solo or uncertain
        - **spec-driven development (SDD)**: when task is big, collaborative, or critical
    -  need to tease out and expand on this distinction
        - story writing vs bug triage vs prototyping vs ?
        - how does testing factor in?
        - how is a SDD different from John D's "plan" approach
- leverage **context engineering**
    - to facilitate more specific, useful and accurate responses
    - to facilitate consistency across prompts
