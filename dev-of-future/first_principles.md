# first principles

## guiding metaphor (Yegge/HKim)

“In this new world, you’re the head chef of a world-class kitchen. As such, you don’t personally dice every vegetable, sear every steak, swish away every cockroach, or plate every dish. You have sous chefs and line chefs for that. But when a meal leaves the kitchen, it’s your reputation on the line and your Michelin stars at stake. When the customer sends back the fish because it’s overdone or the sauce is broken, you can’t blame your sous chef.
 
The same principle applies when coding with AI: Delegation of implementation doesn’t mean delegation of responsibility.”

Steve Yegge & Gene Kim, [Vibe Coding](https://www.amazon.com/Vibe-Coding-Building-Production-Grade-Software/dp/1966280025/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0) (2025)

## problem domain: developer skills
- orchestration vs coding (see guiding metaphor)
- technical
    - AI literacy
        - AI tool fluency
        - AI workflow (SDD)
    - system design/architecture
- non-technical
    - critical thinking
    - problem solving
    - cross-functional communication

## problem domain: new constraints/opportunities
- volume and speed of AI output
 - natural throttles
  - human need/ability to understand
  - human need/ability to validate
- pre/post-development tasks
    - story creation
    - story testing/validation
- basic situation
    - concern with value is constant
    - delivery speed is increasing
    - how do you ensure quality does not decrease
 

## misc
- prompt vs spec engineering
    - [article](https://strategizeyourcareer.com/p/prompt-engineering-vs-spec-engineering)
        - **prompt engineering**: when task is small, solo or uncertain
        - **spec-driven development (SDD)**: when task is big, collaborative, or critical
    -  need to tease out and expand on this distinction
        - story writing vs bug triage vs prototyping vs ?
        - how does testing factor in?
        - how is a SDD different from John D's "plan" approach
- leverage **context engineering**
    - to facilitate more specific, useful and accurate responses
    - to facilitate consistency across prompts
