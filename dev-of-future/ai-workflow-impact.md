# ai impact on code

I'm responsible for integrating AI coding tools into our developer organization. 
It seems reasonable that AI coding tools will have an impact on developer workflows, 
including the SDLC their team uses. While these tools focus on coding assistants, 
they are not limited to them. They can also include things like AI agentic tooling and MCP Servers.

I'm looking for information and guidance on how to effectively and efficiently

* gather data on how AI coding tools are changing software development workflows (including the overall SDLC)
* analyze this data to discern any patterns of change
* assess whether we should encourage or discourage the patterns we discern
* devise and implement plans for encouraging and discouraging relevant changes

Our organization is medium sized (approximately 400 developers) and normally does not engage in complex or rigid processes.

Pease respond with an action plan that is organized around the 4 bullets above and that is detailed
