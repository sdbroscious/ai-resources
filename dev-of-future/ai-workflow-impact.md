# ai impact on code

I'm responsible for integrating AI coding tools into our developer organization. 
It seems reasonable that AI coding tools will have an impact on developer workflows, 
including the SDLC their team uses. 


I'm looking for information and guidance on how to effectively and efficiently

* gather data on how AI coding tools are changing developer workflows, including SDLC
* analyze this data to discern any patterns of change
* assess whether we should encourage or discourage the patterns we discern
* devise and implement plans for encouraging and discouraging relevant changes

Our organization is medium sized (approximately 400 developers) and normally does not engage in complex or rigid processes.
