# Developer Diary Template

This template is designed for developers to quickly log how AI coding assistants affect their daily or weekly work. Entries can later be aggregated and analyzed to detect workflow pattern changes across teams.

## 1. Work Context
- **Date:**  
- **Developer (optional):**  
- **Team:**  
- **Main task(s) worked on:**

## 2. AI Usage
- **Did you use an AI coding tool today?** (Yes/No)  
- **Which tool(s)?** (Copilot, Coding Agent, MCP server, other)  
- **How much of your work involved AI?**  
  - ☐ None  
  - ☐ A little (<25%)  
  - ☐ Moderate (25–75%)

## 5. Challenges
- **Where did AI slow you down, confuse you, or create extra rework?**  
- **Any quality issues introduced by AI suggestions?**  

---

## 6. Collaboration & Review
- **Did AI change how you interacted with your team (e.g., in code reviews, handoffs, discussions)?**  
- **Did you test or review AI-generated code differently than your own?**  

---

## 7. Overall Sentiment
- **How did using AI affect your day?**  
  - ☐ Positive  
  - ☐ Negative  
  - ☐ Mixed  
- **Would you want to use AI more, less, or about the same tomorrow? Why?**

✅ **How to use:**  
- Fill in daily or weekly (5–10 minutes).  
- Responses can be collected in Markdown files, spreadsheets, or a form.  
- Entries can be coded using common categories (AI use type, workflow shift, outcome, sentiment, collaboration) for pattern analysis.
