# Spec-Driven Development Overview

## why
- crisis of abundance
- getting to deterministic
- paved path
    - path of least resistance

## Components

- spec-driven process
- constitution ('governance as code')
    - custom instructions
    - custom agents
    - custom prompts
- delivery mechanism
    - github action style
    - surveyor chore
    - federated central repo
        - balance central standards with team autonomy

## spec-driven process
- what steps?
    - constitution
    - specify
    - clarify (from Spec Kit)
    - plan
    - tasks
    - analyze (from Spec Kit)
    - implement
- how formal or loose of a process?
- do we create our own or adopt existing?

- if we create our own, do we do more than outline?
- how many variations should we consider?
- what type of process
    - spec-first
    - spec-anchored
    - spec-as-source
- what type of work?
    - green/brown
    - story/feature/epic
- how do we field test?

## custom instructions
- what types of instructions do we need
    - by language
    - by coding approach (e.g., TDD)
    - by framework
    - by quality
    - by security
