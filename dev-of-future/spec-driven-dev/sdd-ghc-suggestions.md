## Key Planning Areas

### Success Metrics & Measurement
- How will the effectiveness of SDD be measured?
- What KPIs or metrics (velocity, defect rate, lead time, satisfaction) will be tracked?
- How will learnings be captured and reported?

### Stakeholder Roles & Responsibilities
- Who are the participants? (spec authors, reviewers, implementers, owners)
- What are their responsibilities in each phase?
- How is spec/change governance handled?

### Onboarding, Enablement & Adoption Strategy
- What documentation, examples, and support materials are needed for onboarding?
- How are teams introduced and trained on SDD?
- Strategy for phased rollout or pilot programs
- How is migration from legacy processes supported?

### Tooling & Automation
- What integrations with existing tools (IDEs, issue trackers, CI/CD, code review, etc.) are needed?
- What automation can be provided for spec validation, enforcement, and artifact generation?
- How are spec and process artifacts versioned and managed?

### Exception & Flexibility Handling
- How are cases managed where the spec process cannot be strictly followed?
- Guidance for exceptions, emergency changes, and approvals

### Feedback Mechanisms & Continuous Improvement
- How is feedback from teams gathered?
- What is the retrospective mechanism for evolving the process?
- How are updates and improvements communicated?

### Compliance, Legal, and Ethics
- Alignment with regulatory and compliance standards (security, privacy, audit)
- Licensing implications for artifacts/tools
- Ethical considerations (AI-generated content, governance)

### Communication & Change Management
- How are updates to the framework, processes, and best practices communicated?
- What is the change management workflow?

### Examples & Case Studies
- Where are real-world, sample specs and case studies documented?
- Common usage examples, templates, and pitfalls

### Interoperability & Compatibility
- How does SDD complement or integrate with Agile, DevOps, CI/CD, design-driven, or other methodologies?
- Compatibility strategies for existing processes, repositories, and tools
