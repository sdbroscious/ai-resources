## embracing AI
- technical
    - **AI fluency**
        - tooling (GHC, Claude Code, MCP Server)
        - workflow (SDD)
    - *design skills*
- non-technical
    - *critical thinking*
    - *problem solving*
    - *x-function communication*

## absorbing AI flow
- de-risking strategies
    - **workflow spec-driven development**
        - define
        - build
        - promote
- ensure steady work throughput
    - focus on dev inputs (stories), not outputs (testing)

#### key
**bold** = focus on P&C IT</br>
